/**
 * CDK APPLICATION ENTRY POINT
 * 
 * This is the main entry point for the AWS CDK application that deploys the Hello World
 * serverless application across multiple AWS accounts using AWS Control Tower governance.
 * This file orchestrates the creation of CloudFormation stacks for each environment
 * with appropriate configurations and AWS account targeting.
 * 
 * Architecture Overview:
 * - Multi-account deployment using AWS Control Tower accounts
 * - Environment-specific stack creation (dev, staging, shared, prod)
 * - Account-aware resource targeting through environment variables
 * - Centralized configuration management through accounts.ts
 * - Global tagging strategy for governance and cost tracking
 * 
 * Deployment Strategy:
 * - Each environment gets its own CloudFormation stack
 * - Each stack is deployed to its designated AWS account
 * - Account IDs are resolved through environment variables
 * - Consistent naming and tagging across all environments
 * 
 * Environment Variable Dependencies:
 * - DEV_ACCOUNT_ID: AWS account ID for development environment
 * - STAGING_ACCOUNT_ID: AWS account ID for staging environment
 * - SHARED_ACCOUNT_ID: AWS account ID for shared services
 * - PROD_ACCOUNT_ID: AWS account ID for production environment
 * - CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT: Fallback account ID for local development
 * - CDK_DEFAULT_REGION: AWS region for all deployments (default: us-east-1)
 * 
 * Control Tower Integration:
 * - Designed to work with AWS Control Tower multi-account setup
 * - Supports cross-account deployment through CDK bootstrapping
 * - Follows AWS Control Tower best practices for account separation
 * - Enables centralized governance and compliance monitoring
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - `cdk synth`: Generate CloudFormation templates for all environments
 * - `cdk deploy`: Deploy all stacks (requires appropriate AWS credentials)
 * - `cdk deploy helloworld-dev`: Deploy only the development environment
 * - `cdk destroy`: Remove all deployed resources

 * Multi-Environment Stack Deployment Loop
 * 
 * Iterates through all configured environments and creates a separate CloudFormation
 * stack for each one. Each stack is targeted at a specific AWS account and configured
 * with environment-appropriate settings from the accounts configuration.
 * 
 * Deployment Pattern:
 * - One stack per environment (dev, staging, shared, prod)
 * - Each stack deployed to its designated AWS account
 * - Environment-specific naming and configuration
 * - Consistent structure across all environments
 * 
 * Account Resolution Strategy:
 * - Primary: Environment-specific variables (DEV_ACCOUNT_ID, PROD_ACCOUNT_ID, etc.)
 * - Fallback: CDK default account for local development
 * - Region: CDK default region with us-east-1 fallback
 * 
 * Stack Naming Convention:
 * - Format: helloworld-{environment}
 * - Examples: helloworld-dev, helloworld-staging, helloworld-prod
 * - Enables easy identification and targeted deployment
