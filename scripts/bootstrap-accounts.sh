# CDK Bootstrap Script for Multi-Account Control Tower Setup
# ==========================================================
# This script prepares all AWS workload accounts for CDK deployments by:
# 1. Installing the CDK toolkit stack in each account
# 2. Creating necessary IAM roles and S3 buckets for deployments
# 3. Setting up cross-account trust relationships
#
# IMPORTANT: This must be run AFTER Control Tower creates the workload accounts
# and BEFORE any CDK deployments can happen.

# Load environment variables containing account IDs
# The .env file is created by ./scripts/get-account-ids.sh and contains:
# - dev_account_id, staging_account_id, shared_account_id, prod_account_id
# - management_account_id (the account you're currently logged into)
source .env

# Verify we have the required environment variables
# This checks if ANY of the account ID variables are empty or unset
# The -z test returns TRUE if a variable is empty (zero length)
# The || operator means "OR" - if ANY condition is true, the whole expression is true
# So this reads as: "If dev_account_id is empty OR staging_account_id is empty OR..."
if [ -z "$dev_account_id" ] || [ -z "$staging_account_id" ] || [ -z "$shared_account_id" ] || [ -z "$prod_account_id" ]; then
    # If we get here, at least one required account ID is missing
