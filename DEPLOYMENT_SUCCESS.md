### ðŸ”„ From Here

You now have a **production-ready AWS foundation** that typically takes weeks to set up manually. You can:

1. **Add more applications** using the same CDK patterns
2. **Scale to more environments** by extending the account configuration
3. **Add monitoring and observability** with the existing infrastructure
4. **Implement CI/CD pipelines** using the established SSO profiles

### ðŸ’° Monthly Cost Estimate

- **Infrastructure**: ~$35-70 USD/month (varies by usage)
- **ROI**: Saved 50+ hours of manual setup time
- **Value**: Enterprise-grade foundation for the cost of a few coffee subscriptions
