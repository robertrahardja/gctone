/**
 * ACCOUNTS CONFIGURATION FILE
 * 
 * This file defines the multi-environment AWS account structure for AWS Control Tower.
 * It provides centralized configuration for deploying applications across different 
 * environments (dev, staging, shared, prod) with environment-specific settings.
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * - Defines account configurations for AWS Control Tower workload accounts
 * - Provides environment-specific resource sizing for cost optimization
 * - Maps email addresses to AWS accounts for Control Tower setup
 * - Centralizes application configuration (messages, timeouts, memory)
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Used by CDK stacks to deploy resources with environment-appropriate settings
 * - Controls Lambda memory allocation and timeout based on environment
 * - Provides email mapping for AWS Control Tower account creation
 * - Enables consistent tagging and resource naming across environments
 */

/**
 * Interface defining the configuration structure for each AWS workload account.
 * 
 * This interface ensures type safety and consistency across all environment configurations.
 * Each property controls specific aspects of the deployed infrastructure:
 * 
 * - name: Human-readable account name for identification and tagging
 * - email: Email address used for AWS account creation in Control Tower
 * - environment: Environment type that determines deployment behavior
 * - helloworldmessage: Custom message returned by the Lambda function
 * - memorysize: Lambda memory allocation in MB (cost optimization)
 * - timeout: Lambda timeout in seconds (performance vs cost balance)

/**
 * Workload account configurations for AWS Control Tower multi-environment setup.
 * 
 * This Record defines four separate AWS accounts, each with environment-specific settings
 * optimized for different stages of the software development lifecycle. The configuration
 * implements a cost-optimization strategy where development environments use minimal resources
 * and production environments use full resources.
 * 
 * Resource Scaling Strategy:
 * - Development: Minimal resources (128MB, 10s timeout) for cost savings
 * - Staging: Moderate resources (256MB, 15s timeout) for testing
 * - Shared: Moderate resources (256MB, 15s timeout) for shared services
 * - Production: Full resources (512MB, 30s timeout) for performance
 * 
 * Email Strategy:
 * Uses Gmail alias pattern (email+alias@gmail.com) to create separate AWS accounts
 * while using a single email address. This is a common pattern for Control Tower setup.
