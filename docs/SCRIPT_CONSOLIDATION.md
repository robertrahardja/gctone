# Script Consolidation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Consolidated Scripts for New Users

To make the setup experience much easier for new users, we've created
consolidated scripts that combine multiple operations:

### **Primary Script: Complete Environment Setup**

```bash
./scripts/setup-complete-environment.sh
```

**What it does:**

- âœ… Discovers all Control Tower account IDs
- âœ… Sets up SSO user assignments automatically
- âœ… Creates SSO profiles for all accounts
- âœ… Waits for SSO access to become ready
- âœ… Bootstraps CDK in all accounts
- âœ… Validates the complete setup

**Time:** 10-15 minutes (mostly AWS provisioning wait time)

### **Supporting Scripts**

#### SSO Simple Setup

```bash
./scripts/setup-sso-simple.sh [email@domain.com]
```

- âœ… Creates SSO profiles
- âœ… Assigns current user to all accounts
- âœ… Tests and validates access
- âœ… Provides next steps

#### Complete Validation

```bash
./scripts/validate-complete-setup.sh [--verbose]
```

- âœ… Validates all prerequisites
- âœ… Checks account discovery
- âœ… Tests SSO profiles
- âœ… Verifies CDK bootstrap
- âœ… Provides status report with fix suggestions

## ðŸ”„ Before vs After

### **Before Consolidation (Complex)**

```bash
# Old way - 8 separate commands
./scripts/get-account-ids.sh
./scripts/setup-automated-sso.sh
./scripts/assign-sso-permissions-fast.sh
./scripts/wait-for-sso-access.sh
./scripts/check-sso-status.sh
./scripts/bootstrap-accounts.sh
./scripts/validate-deployments.sh
# Plus manual verification steps
```

### **After Consolidation (Simple)**

```bash
# New way - 1 command
./scripts/setup-complete-environment.sh

# Optional: validate everything
./scripts/validate-complete-setup.sh
```

## ðŸ’¡ Benefits for New Users

### **Reduced Complexity**

- **8 scripts** â†’ **1 script** (87% reduction)
- **15+ commands** â†’ **1 command** (93% reduction)
- **Multiple failure points** â†’ **Single, robust workflow**

### **Better Error Handling**

- Consolidated scripts have better error messages
- Clear troubleshooting guidance
- Automatic retry logic for AWS provisioning delays

### **Improved User Experience**

- Progress indicators and status updates
- Color-coded output for easy scanning
- Clear next steps after completion

### **Consistent Results**

- Eliminates human error from running steps out of order
- Ensures all prerequisites are checked
- Validates success before proceeding

## ðŸš€ Greenfield Setup Flow

### **Complete New Project Setup**

```bash
# 1. After Control Tower manual setup is complete
./scripts/setup-complete-environment.sh

# 2. Optional: Verify everything works
./scripts/validate-complete-setup.sh --verbose

# 3. Ready to deploy applications!
./scripts/deploy-applications.sh
```

**Total time:** ~15 minutes (vs ~45 minutes with individual scripts)

## ðŸ”§ Individual Scripts Still Available

All original scripts remain available for:

- **Debugging specific issues**
- **Advanced users who want granular control**
- **Existing projects that prefer incremental updates**

### **Quick Reference**

- `setup-sso-simple.sh` - Just SSO setup
- `check-sso-status.sh` - Quick status check
- `bootstrap-accounts.sh` - Just CDK bootstrap
- `validate-complete-setup.sh` - Comprehensive validation

## ðŸ“‹ Updated ct_guide.md

The main guide now features:

- **Option A**: Complete automated setup (recommended for greenfield)
- **Option B**: Individual automated steps (for troubleshooting)
- **Option C**: Manual setup (legacy approach)

This gives users choice while steering them toward the most efficient path.

## ðŸŽ¯ Perfect for Greenfield Projects

The consolidated approach is ideal for:

- âœ… **First-time Control Tower users**
- âœ… **New AWS projects**
- âœ… **DevOps teams wanting quick setup**
- âœ… **Anyone following the guide start-to-finish**

The scripts handle all the complex timing issues, regional configurations,
and user identity management that we discovered during development.
